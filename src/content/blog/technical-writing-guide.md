Technical writing doesn't have to be dry or boring. In this guide, we'll explore how to create
engaging documentation that readers actually want to read.

## Why Good Documentation Matters

Have you ever struggled with poorly written documentation? We've all been there. Good technical
writing can make the difference between a successful project and a frustrated team.

### Key Elements of Technical Writing

1. **Clarity**: Every sentence should serve a purpose
2. **Structure**: Information should flow logically
3. **Examples**: Show, don't just tell

## Code Examples

Here's a simple Python function that demonstrates clean code with good documentation:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate average of empty list")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

## Using Tables for Comparison

Here's how different documentation approaches compare:

| Approach | Pros                     | Cons                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Wiki     | Easy to edit             | Can become disorganized |
| PDF      | Professional looking     | Hard to maintain        |
| Markdown | Version control friendly | Limited formatting      |

## Including Images

Images can greatly enhance documentation. Here's a placeholder for a diagram:

## Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are a great way to provide additional context and make your documentation more
accessible. Here's an example of a link to a GitHub repository:

## Mathematical Expressions

When documenting algorithms, you might need to include mathematical expressions. For example, the
time complexity of binary search is $ O(\log n) $

## Tips for Better Documentation

-   Write with your audience in mind
-   Update documentation regularly
-   Include troubleshooting guides
-   Gather feedback from users

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Assuming too much knowledge
2. Using jargon without explanation
3. Neglecting to update examples
4. Focusing on features instead of solutions

## Advanced Topics

> **Note**: The following section assumes familiarity with basic concepts.

### Version Control Integration

```bash
# Add documentation changes
git add docs/*
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"
```

`inline code`

## Conclusion

Remember that good documentation is a journey, not a destination. Keep iterating and improving based
on user feedback.
