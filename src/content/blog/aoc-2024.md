## Day 1: Historian Hysteria

First day of AoC 2024! This year I decided to do all my solutions in [Go](https://golang.org).

Today's problem was pretty easy. You're given a list of integers, 2 in each row (separated by 3
spaces).

For part 1, you need to pair the smallest number on the left with the smallest on the right, then
the second smallest, then the third, and so on. For example,

```
1   4
3   1
4   3
8   2
```

Would be paired as `(1, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (8, 4)`. Then, you need to sum up the differences
between each pair. With the above example, the sum would be `0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 6`.

My approach for part 1 was to first separate the numbers into two lists `left` and `right`, sort
them, and iterate over the left list calculating the absolute difference between each pair. Since we
know the right list is the same length as the left, we can just iterate over one and associate the
index with the other.

```go
left := make([]int, 0)
right := make([]int, 0)

// parse input ...

sort.Ints(left)
sort.Ints(right)

for i := 0; i < len(left); i++ {
 out += int(math.Abs(float64(left[i] - right[i])))
}
```

Pretty easy!

For part 2, you need to multiply each number in the left list by the number of times it appears in
the right list and sum up the results. For the above example, the result would be
`(1 * 1) + (3 * 1) + (4 * 1) + (8 * 1) = 16`.

My approach in part 2 was to make a hashmap of the right list associating each number with its
frequency, then iterate over the left list and multiply each number by its frequency in the hashmap.

```go
freq := make(map[int]int)
for _, num := range right {
 freq[num]++
}

for _, num := range left {
    if f, exists := freq[num]; exists {
 out += num * f
 }
}
```

For this part, you could use a nested for loop, but I wanted it to be a bit faster. The nested for
loop is O(n^2), whereas the hashmap is O(n).

Overall, today was pretty easy, about a 1/10 difficulty. _See you tomorrow!_
